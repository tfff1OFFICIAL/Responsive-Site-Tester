# tfff1's Responsive Site Tester

This small program was created for programmers who would like to test their responsive websites in multiple sizes without switching devices.

More Preset Sizes might be added as times goes on, but in the meantime, if you want to test on a different size then just manually set it.
Another thing to note is that the preset sizes are based on functional screen space, not the actual size of the device's screen
